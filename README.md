# 🌐 Web Dev Practice — SEUCRA

Welcome to my **web development practice repository** — a hands-on collection of mini-projects built with HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. This repo is my sandbox for exploring:

- Semantic HTML
- CSS layouts (Flexbox, Grid, Box Model)
- Forms and accessibility
- Responsive design
- CSS art and animations

These projects are built as part of my learning journey and lay the groundwork for more complex front-end projects in the future.
