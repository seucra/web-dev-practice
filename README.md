# üåê Web Dev Practice ‚Äî SEUCRA

Welcome to my **web development practice repository** ‚Äî a hands-on collection of mini-projects built with HTML and CSS (and some JS). This repo is my sandbox for exploring layout techniques, CSS tricks, forms, responsive design, accessibility, and more.

These projects were created as part of my learning journey and serve as a foundation for future, more complex front-end development.
