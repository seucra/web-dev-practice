		<section id="about" aria-labelledby="Early Life of Mahatma Gandhi">
			<h1>Early Life</h1>
			<h3>Birth and Family</h3>
			<p>
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in the coastal town of Porbandar in present-day Gujarat, India. He was the youngest 
child of Karamchand Gandhi, the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar, and Putlibai, a deeply religious woman who strongly influenced his 
spiritual development.
			</p>
			<h3>Childhood and Education</h3>
			<p>
As a child, Gandhi was quiet and introspective. Though not particularly outstanding in academics or sports, he showed early signs of empathy, 
honesty, and curiosity. He married Kasturba Gandhi at the age of 13 in an arranged marriage, which was customary at the time.
			</p>
			<p>
After completing his early schooling in Rajkot, Gandhi traveled to London in 1888 to study law at Inner Temple, one of the city’s prestigious 
law colleges. During his time in England, Gandhi adopted a modest lifestyle and began exploring religion and philosophy, reading sacred texts 
from various traditions—including the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible, and works by Tolstoy.
			</p>
			<h3>Formative Influences</h3>
			<p>
The values of nonviolence, vegetarianism, and truth were deeply instilled in him by his family and later reinforced through his personal 
exploration of various faiths and ideologies. These early years laid the foundation for his lifelong commitment to moral integrity and 
nonviolent resistance.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sforf" aria-labelledby="Strugle for Freedom">
			<h1>Strugle for Freedom</h1>

			<h2>Journey in South Africa (1893–1914)</h1>
			<p>
Mahatma Gandhi's transformation from a timid lawyer to a determined activist began not in India, but in South Africa.
			</p>
			<p>
In 1893, Gandhi traveled to South Africa to work as a legal advisor for an Indian firm. It was there that he experienced racial 
discrimination firsthand—most notably when he was thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg for refusing to leave a first-class compartment, 
despite holding a valid ticket. This moment was a turning point in his life.
			</p>
			<h3>Key Contributions in South Africa:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
<span>Formation of Natal Indian Congress (1894):</span> Gandhi founded this organization to unite the Indian community and fight against 
racial injustices.
				</li>
				<li>
<span>Civil Rights Campaigns:</span> He led peaceful protests against oppressive laws targeting Indians, such as the £3 tax and the 
registration law requiring Indians to carry identity documents.
				</li>
				<li>
<span>Introduction of Satyagraha (Truth-Force):</span> Gandhi developed and practiced this philosophy of nonviolent resistance, which 
would become central to all his future struggles.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
Over 21 years in South Africa, Gandhi refined his methods of protest, emphasizing civil disobedience, truth, and nonviolence. His work 
laid the foundation for his later leadership in India.
			</p>

			<h2>Freedom Strugle in India</h1>
			<p>
Gandhi returned to India in 1915, already recognized as a respected leader. Over the next three decades, he would become the face of the 
Indian independence movement, mobilizing millions through peaceful means.
			</p>
			<h3>Major Movements Led by Gandhi:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
<span>Champaran Satyagraha (1917):</span> His first major success in India, helping poor indigo farmers in Bihar who were being exploited 
by British landlords.
				</li>
				<li>
<span>Kheda Satyagraha (1918):</span> Gandhi supported farmers in Gujarat who were unable to pay taxes due to crop failure, demanding tax 
relief through nonviolent protest.
				</li>
				<li>
<span>Non-Cooperation Movement (1920–22):</span> A nationwide call to boycott British institutions, including schools, courts, and imported 
goods. Gandhi urged Indians to spin their own cloth (khadi) and reject foreign goods.
				</li>
				<li>
<span>Salt March / Dandi March (1930):</span> A 240-mile march to the Arabian Sea to protest the British monopoly on salt. This act of civil 
disobedience captured global attention and became a symbol of resistance.
				</li>
				<li>
<span>Quit India Movement (1942):</span> Gandhi's most direct challenge to British rule. He called for immediate independence, saying, 
“Do or Die.” The British arrested thousands, including Gandhi himself.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Legacy & Impact</h1>
			<p>
Mahatma Gandhi’s influence transcends time, geography, and culture. His pioneering use of nonviolent resistance to challenge colonial rule 
reshaped the course of history, demonstrating that true power lies not in weapons or violence but in the moral courage of peaceful action.
			</p>
			<p>
Gandhi’s leadership was instrumental in ending nearly two centuries of British colonial rule in India, culminating in independence in 1947. 
Yet, his impact was far more than political. He redefined the idea of leadership as service, humility, and truthfulness. His call for 
“Swaraj” (self-rule) went beyond political sovereignty; it embraced economic self-sufficiency, ethical living, and social justice.
			</p>
Globally, Gandhi inspired civil rights and freedom movements, including the American civil rights movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., 
the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa spearheaded by Nelson Mandela, and numerous nonviolent campaigns worldwide. His philosophy gave 
oppressed peoples a tool to fight injustice without hatred or retaliation.
			<p>
In India, Gandhi is affectionately called the “Father of the Nation”, and his birthday, October 2nd, is observed as a national holiday and 
the International Day of Non-Violence by the United Nations. Numerous monuments, institutions, roads, and awards bear his name, reflecting 
his enduring presence in Indian society.
			</p>
			<p>
His teachings continue to influence contemporary issues like environmentalism, economic equity, human rights, and conflict resolution. 
Gandhi’s vision of a just world remains a beacon for activists, scholars, and leaders committed to peace and dignity for all.
			</p>

			<h1>Philosophies & Beliefs</h1>

Gandhi’s life was a profound testament to living one’s beliefs with unwavering consistency. His philosophies are deeply intertwined and reflect a holistic worldview centered on truth, nonviolence, and compassion.

Ahimsa (Nonviolence): Gandhi championed nonviolence as a supreme ethical principle and a practical political strategy. He believed that true courage is the refusal to inflict harm on others, and that lasting social change can only be achieved through peaceful means.

Satyagraha (Truth-Force): This concept of “holding firmly to truth” combined passive resistance with active civil disobedience. Gandhi’s Satyagraha was not merely political protest but a moral practice demanding inner truthfulness and outer courage.

Swaraj (Self-Rule): For Gandhi, Swaraj meant more than independence from colonial rule; it was about self-discipline, personal responsibility, and economic self-sufficiency. He encouraged Indians to spin their own cloth (khadi) as a symbol of rejecting foreign domination and embracing self-reliance.

Simple Living: Gandhi lived modestly, wearing homespun clothes, eating vegetarian food, and practicing self-restraint. He believed that material possessions distract from spiritual growth and social responsibility.

Religious Pluralism: Gandhi respected all religions and saw unity in diversity as essential to peace. He drew inspiration from Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Jainism, and Buddhism, advocating tolerance and interfaith harmony.

Social Equality: Deeply committed to eradicating social injustice, Gandhi worked tirelessly against untouchability and caste discrimination, calling the marginalized “Harijans” (children of God). He envisioned an India where all people, regardless of caste or creed, could live with dignity.

Non-possession: Gandhi encouraged detachment from material wealth, promoting that one should own only what is necessary and use resources responsibly.

Truth as Ultimate Reality: For Gandhi, truth was the highest value, intertwined with God. To seek truth was a lifelong spiritual quest.

Education: He believed in education rooted in moral values, self-reliance, and practical skills, emphasizing character building over rote learning.

Empowerment of Women: Gandhi advocated for women’s active participation in social reform and political struggle, believing in their inherent strength and moral power.

Through these philosophies, Gandhi offered a transformative model of leadership and activism—one that integrates personal ethics with social responsibility, inspiring millions across generations.
